# UNLOCODE-SEEKER
Program created to download the Complete list of United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations (UN/LOCODE, UNLOCODE, UN LOCODE, ETC) from the official website using an algorithm designed for future changes of the url according to the date of the file to be downloaded .. Save this information in the database to be able to make individual queries according to their function and name ..

# Way of use :

Paste the project folder into: 
C:\

Would look like this
C:\UNLOCODE-SEPARATOR\

# Structure :

It is a basic dataflex project with its generic structure

Binaries are stored in:
C:\UNLOCODE-SEPARATOR\Programs

Temporary folders: 

(C:\UNLOCODE-SEPARATOR\Data\TEMP)
Function: folder where the compressed file that is downloaded from
Http://www.unece.org/cefact/codesfortrade/codes_index.html, unzipped files, .bat file to rename, .bat file to do dir, etc.

Static Folders: 

(C:\UNLOCODE-SEPARATOR\Data\STATIC)
Function: folder where you save .bat file to delete and make temporary folder, executables and dll of 7zip portable version to decompress the downloaded file.

by the way :

After looking for something similar to dataflex and I did not find anything I decided to do it and publish it in case someone could be useful at any time.

Is only a beginning of the way I hope you can use some help, they can use part of the code for their own projects or modify this.

Namaste.
